# CoSERV: Concise Selector for Endorsements and Reference Values

---

# Why CoSERV?

* Conveyance of Endorsements and RVs to the Verifier is within the scope of RFC9334
* It is also a proven industry requirement, evidenced by services such as NVIDIA RIM and AMD KDS
* Existing solutions exhibit fragmentation - proprietary APIs and disjoint data formats
* Fragmentation worsens as such services become more numerous - makes life hard for Verifiers
* How does RATS offer better industry guidance?
* Do we need to define more reference interaction models, or even include concrete API definitions (OpenAPI specs)?
* Any such API would need a data format to transact - a query/response language tailored towards RATS artefacts
* This is a good, self-contained thing to define in a draft and validate through prototyping
* Enter CoSERV - the Concise Selector for Endorsements and Reference Values

---

# Requirements and Guiding Principles

* Decoupling of message and transport (eg. could transact over HTTP/REST or CoAP)
* Adaptable to different interaction models (eg. fetch everything, fetch deltas, pub/sub)
* Efficient use of the transport (eg. amenable to client-side or server-side caching)
* Support constrained consumers - optimise data volume and minimise client-side processing burden
* Specialise for "RATS-native" artefacts (endorsed values, reference values, trust anchors), but allow some extensibility
* Re-use existing RATS designs where possible, and align to CDDL data model
* Allow distributors to aggregate multiple sources, with flexible trust models

# In a nutshell

Self-contained CBOR data item to model an "endorsement" query and the optional result set

```
coserv = {
  &(profile: 0) => profile
  &(query: 1) => query
  ? &(results: 2) => results
}
```

Basic building block for an "endorsement distribution API"

---

# CoSERV Queries

```
query = {
  &(artifact-type: 0) => artifact-type
  &(environment-selector: 1) => environment-selector-map
}
```

What artifact you are interested in (RVs, TAs, etc.)?

The attesters you are interested in?

---

# Query Selectors

```
environment-selector-map = { selector }

selector //= ( &(class: 0) => [ + class-map ] )
selector //= ( &(instance: 1) => [ + $instance-id-type-choice ] )
selector //= ( &(group: 2) => [ + $group-id-type-choice ] )
```

---

# Query Selectors Semantics

Class selectors:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM reference_values
 WHERE ( class-id = "iZl4ZVY=" AND class-vendor = "ACME Inc." ) OR
       ( class-id = "31fb5abf-023e-4992-aa4e-95f9c1503bfa" )
```

Instance selectors:

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM endorsed_values
 WHERE ( instance-id = "At6tvu/erQ==" ) OR
       ( instance-id = "iZl4ZVY=" )`
```

---

# Result Set

```
results = {
  result-set
  &(expiry: 10) => tdate ; RFC3339 date
}

result-set //= reference-values
result-set //= endorsed-values
result-set //= trust-anchors
```

Expressed as CoRIM triples + authority (quads)

--- 

# Reference Values' Result Set

For example:

```
refval-quad = {
  &(authority: 1) => $crypto-key-type-choice
  &(rv-triple: 2) => reference-triple-record
}

reference-values = (
  &(rvq: 0) => [ * refval-quad ]
)

```

---

# Prototyping

* Veraison has a rich history as a proving ground for RATS designs
* Was built as a Verifier, but can be re-purposed as an Endorser or Reference Value Provider with new API endpoints, transacting CoSERV
* PoC exercise is currently in flight
* [`corim git:(coserv)`](https://github.com/veraison/corim/compare/main...coserv)
* [`services git:(coserv)`](https://github.com/veraison/services/compare/main...coserv)

#Â Veraison Prototype (Details)

# Prototype API

Simple request-response over HTTP using `GET`

CoSERV quert is in the outer-most path segment (allow caching)

Parameterised media type (`profile` is a CoRIM profile)

---

## Request

```http
GET /endorsement-distribution/v1/coserv/ogB4I3R... HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:11443
Accept: application/coserv+cbor; \
        profile="tag:arm.com,2023:cca_platform#1.0.0"
```

---

## Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 
Content-Type: application/coserv+cbor
Content-Length: 702
Date: Tue, 15 Apr 2025 10:37:28 GMT

{
  / profile / 0: "tag:arm.com,2023:cca_platform#1.0.0",
  / query / 1: {
    / artifact / 0: 2, / reference-values /
    / environment-selector / 1: {
      / class / 0: [
        { / class-id / 0: 600(h'7f45...') / impl-id / }
      ]
    }
  },
  / results / 2: { ...  }
}
```

# New `coserv-service`

[.code-highlight: 2, 9-10]
```go
const (
  edApiPath = "/endorsement-distribution/v1"
)

func NewRouter(handler Handler) *gin.Engine {
  // ...
  router.GET("/.well-known/veraison/endorsement-distribution", handler.GetEdApiWellKnownInfo)

  coservEndpoint := path.Join(edApiPath, "coserv/:query")
  router.GET(coservEndpoint, handler.CoservRequest)

  // ...
}
```

---

# New VTS Service

```proto
service VTS {
  // endorsement distribution API
  rpc GetEndorsements(EndorsementQueryIn) returns (EndorsementQueryOut);
  // ...
}
```

```proto
message EndorsementQueryIn {
  string media_type = 1; // media type (including profile)
  string query = 2;      // base64url-encoded CoSERV
}

message EndorsementQueryOut {
  Status status = 1;
  bytes result_set = 2;  // CBOR-encoded result-set CoSERV
}
```

# Plugins

Local mode: reuses / expands `Store` and `Endorsement`[^1] handlers

Proxy mode: new `CoservProxy` handler type

[^1]: Also, small tweak to synthesize a new key for instance queries on ingest.
